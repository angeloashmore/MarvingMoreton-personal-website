              Did you come here for something in particular or just general
              Riker-bashing? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared
              for an instant to be in two places at once. We have a saboteur
              aboard. We know youâ€™re dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk
              about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Could someone
              survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Fate. It
              protects fools, little children, and ships.
